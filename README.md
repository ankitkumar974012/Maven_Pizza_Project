# Maven_Pizza_Project

The Maven Pizza Project involves creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze various aspects of pizza sales data. The project follows a structured approach from data gathering to report creation and security implementation.

Steps Followed:
1. Business Requirement Document (BRD): Explains the tables in the datasets and provides data definitions for each field in the dataset.
2. Data Gathering: Data is gathered from multiple sources including Excel, CSV, and SQL databases.
3. Data Cleaning/Transformation: Necessary data cleaning and transformation are performed.
4. Data Modeling: Relationships between tables are mapped using Star or Snowflake schemas. Fact tables and dimension tables are identified and relationships are established.
5. UI (Power View Reports): DAX functions and calculated columns are used to create interactive reports.
6. DAX Functions: Various DAX functions are utilized for calculations and data manipulation.
7. UI Enhancement: The user interface is enhanced for better usability and aesthetics.
8. Row Level Security (RLS): Implemented to restrict data access based on user roles.


Objectives of Data Analysis:
1. Total Sales/Revenue
2. Total Orders
3. Total Quantity Sold
4. Number of Categories
5. Types of Pizza
6. Average Price
7. Quantity Sold by Category
8. Number of Orders by Time of Day
9. Quantity Sold by Pizza Size
10. Top 5 Pizza Types Sold
11. Bottom 5 Pizza Types Sold
12. Orders by Session
13. Matrix Table for Orders by Day and Time


Key Features of Analysis Process and Steps:
1. Data Import and Transformation: Importing datasets using text/CSV and transforming data in Power Query Editor.
2. Fact and Dimension Tables: Defining and differentiating between transactional data (fact tables) and descriptive data (dimension tables) and creating relationships between tables using the Model Tab in Power BI.
3. Report Creation: Calculating revenue, total orders, and number of pizzas using DAX, categorizing orders by time and day of the week, and creating measures for average order value.
4. Row-Level Security Implementation: Demonstrating RLS for specific roles, such as category heads.

Conclusion:
The Maven Pizza Project is an end-to-end data analysis using Power BI, from data gathering and cleaning to creating interactive reports and implementing security measures. This project highlights proficiency in data modeling, DAX functions, and report creation, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
